# Web-Design-Challenge
## Cop a Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I created a dashboard website using visualizations previously generated in the python-api-challenge repository.

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
